### Parts used:
- *1x* **Raspberry Pi**
- *3x* **PCB P16D boards**
- *12x* **SNx4HC164 8-Bit Parallel-Out Serial Shift Registers**
- *96x* **221Î© resistors**

## Server
This Flask server is running locally on the Raspberry Pi. It is responsible for providing camera image server and controlling the lights through the GPIO on a main server request.

### Get started
The following setup has been testet on the `Raspberry Pi 3` with `Raspbian Buster Lite`.

#### Starting the server

Make sure Python 3.7 is installed. Then run the following:
```
# Install dependencies
$ python3.7 -m pip install pip
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Run the local server
$ flask run
```

#### Setting the server to start on boot
```
$ sudo echo "python3.7 $PWD/app.py" >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

### Built With
**Python 3.7** with the following libraries:
- Flask
- OpenCV
